# goldmark-docx

Experimental library implemented as a [goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark) 
extension for writing out simple .docx files. 

If you need a fully featured markdown to Word Document tool, please look at the awesome [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). 

This library is intended for use in Go projects as a library.


## Why?

Because I thought it would be a nice thing to work on in my spare time.
